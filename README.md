# phpFloodGate
phpFloodGate allows you to set a rate limit, at which your application can be called, only depending on the time between requests. You have a service you want to offer, but it's fairly wasteful with resources, or you just don't want to take the risk? Just use phpFloodGate.

## Requirements
phpFloodGate uses the Alternative PHP Cache (APC), so you need to make sure that's installed and working.
